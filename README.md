JavaScript based platforming game.

# 01/19/19
Code is based off of https://github.com/frankarendpoth/frankarendpoth.github.io/tree/master/content/pop-vlog/javascript/2018/006-rabbit-trap and modified to fit the mechanics, etc. of this game. 

I'm currently working on a Chromebook without the ability to do commits quickly, so there are about to be a bunch of small ones.
